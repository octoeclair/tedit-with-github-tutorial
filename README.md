#Collaborating with Github and Tedit - A Simple Tutorial
##**Tutorial in progress**
1. Download Tedit at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tedit-development-environ/ooekdijbnbbjdfjocaiflnjgoohnblgf?hl=en-US
2. Right click on Tedit and select the option that says "Clone Github Repo".

3. You should get a prompt box looking like this:
![Empty Fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octoeclair/tedit-with-github-tutorial/master/imgs/tedit-tut-1-empty-fields.png)
4. The following steps assume you have already created a repository on Github. If you haven't, click [here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) before continuing.
5. Fill out the fields
  1. Fill out the "user/name" box with your username followed by a slash and then the project name. If I wanted to clone my domcg repository, the box would be filled out with "octoeclair/domcg".
  2. Ignore the "ref/heads/master" field.
  3. You can optionally fill in the "localname" field with the name you want the repository to be called on your computer. If you leave this blank, it will be the actual name (the name on Github). I want domcg to be called "dominion" so I'll write that.
  4. You can leave the encryption passphrase blank, assuming you have a secure computer.
